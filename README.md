my first 2D unity game 

Welcome to my 2D Unity game! This game is a basic 2D spaceship game. It features certain scripts like button, obsticles, speed and velocity physics
movement physics , compression , and optimization
I created this game for fun , as i am not much into game development I have tried Unity for fun. It was built using Unity and programmed in C#.
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement in code , please don't hesitate to let me know."
